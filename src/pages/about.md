      - title: We love detail
        description: >
          In 2011 we started printing citymaps to wallpaper. People loved the
          level of detail. Ten years later we founded Wallcopy. Wallcopy brings
          you text to wallpaper. Recipes, dictionaries, poems, quotes, lyrics or
          your own copy......you name it.

          Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New _and_
          old. Thatâ€™s why we help beginners get started with web development
          through free content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the
          JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) might be one solid pillar on which we
          build that future.
