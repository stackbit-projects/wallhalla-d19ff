      - title: We love detail
        description: >
          In 2011 we started printing citymaps to wallpaper. People loved the
          level of detail. Ten years later we founded Wallcopy. Wallcopy brings
          you text to wallpaper. Recipes, dictionaries, poems, quotes, lyrics or
          your own copy......you name it.

      - title: But keep it quiet
        description: >
          Full blown photowallpaper can be a little overwhelming and over time
          you may get tired with the image chosen to light up a room. Wallpaper
          from Wallcopy is essentially just one plain colour of your choice like
          latex paint. The wall blends in with your interior better, while
          thanks to the wide print technology of today's wallpaper, you have so
          much detail when you look a little closer.
