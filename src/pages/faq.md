    questions:
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >-
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout
          flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

            - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
            - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
            - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          Wallcopy delivers custom orders using colours and size of your choice.
          Every order is unique, which means we would make a loss on any item
          refunded. If we made an error such as the wrong size, different colors
          or printing flaws, an item will be reprocessed. Please be aware that
          colors on the screen can look somewhat different than in print, which
          is why we make the exact color codes part of your order and delivery
          specification for you to determine any actual error made in the
          procss. 
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
        answer: >
          We protect your privacy like we cherish our own. We process a bare
          minimum of data for order fulfillment using Snipcart, which we share
          with our print providers to ship your order. Your payment is processed
          by Stripe. We use encryption and multi factor authentication where we
          can and remove any data when we do not require it anymore for order
          fulfillment or compliance purposes.
      - question: Rapid-fire questions
        answer: >
          Q: Why was no one else selling this up to now? <br /> A: Text requires
          high definition printing and wallpaper with text printed on it is less
          flexible in cutting off edges than wallpaper with pictures. It's a
          specialty we learned to  master.<br />
